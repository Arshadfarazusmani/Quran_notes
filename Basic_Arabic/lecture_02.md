## ⏳ 1. Present & Future Tense (Muzara)
In Arabic, a single verb form (Muzara) covers both the **Present** ("He is doing") and the **Future** ("He will do"). The context determines which one is meant.

### **The Pattern: Ya-F'a-Lu (يَفْعَلُ)**
To turn a past tense verb into the present/future:
1.  Add a **Ya (ي)** at the beginning.
2.  The first letter of the root gets a **Jazm/Sukoon** (Silent).
3.  The middle letter gets a vowel (Zabar, Zer, or Pesh).
4.  The last letter gets a **Pesh (Damma)**.

**Examples:**

| Root Meaning | Past (He did) | Present/Future (He does/will do) | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **To Hit** | Zaraba | **Yaz-ri-bu** | He hits / will hit |
| **To Help** | Nasara | **Yan-su-ru** | He helps / will help |
| **To Hear** | Sami'a | **Yas-ma-'u** | He hears / will hear |
| **To Open** | Fataha | **Yaf-ta-hu** | He opens / will open |
| **To Enter** | Dakhala | **Yad-khu-lu** | He enters / will enter |
| **To Exit** | Kharaja | **Yakh-ru-ju** | He exits / will exit |
| **To Write** | Kataba | **Yak-tu-bu** | He writes / will write |

> **Note:** The middle vowel (Zabar, Zer, Pesh) varies by word, but the meaning remains Present/Future for all.
