Here are the markdown notes for **Arabic Grammar Class #1** by Mufti Tariq Masood.

# 📝 Lecture Notes: Quran Tafseer & Arabic Grammar (Class #1)

## 📖 1. Key Grammar Concept: Masdar (The Source)
* **Definition:** The root of a word/action (similar to the Infinitive or Verb in English).
* **Identification:**
    * **Urdu:** Ends in "na" (e.g., *Khana* (to eat), *Peena* (to drink), *Marna* (to hit)).
    * **Arabic:** Does not have a single fixed shape/marker like Urdu, but these roots form the basis of verbs.
* **Examples:**
    * *Zarb* (To hit)
    * *Sajdah* (To prostrate)
    * *Jamood* (To freeze/be static)

## ⏳ 2. The Past Tense (Active Voice)
The lecture focuses on the **Singular, Male, Third Person** (He did...) in the Past Tense.

### **Rule 1: The Basic Pattern (Fatha-Fatha-Fatha)**
If a three-letter word has a **Zabar (Fatha)** on all three letters, it translates to: **"He [action] in the past."**

| Arabic Word | Root Meaning (Masdar) | Translation (Past Tense) | Timestamp |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zaraba** (ضَرَبَ) | To hit | **He hit** | |
| **Sajada** (سَجَدَ) | To prostrate | **He prostrated** | |
| **Khalaqa** (خَلَقَ) | To create | **He created** | |
| **Wajada** (وَجَدَ) | To find | **He found** | |
| **Nasara** (نَصَرَ) | To help (Nusrat) | **He helped** | |
| **Fataha** (فَتَحَ) | To open/conquer | **He opened** | |

### **Rule 2: Middle Letter Variation**
Sometimes, the middle letter may have a **Zer (Kasra)** or **Pesh (Damma)**. The meaning remains the same (Past Tense, Singular Male).

| Arabic Word | Root Meaning | Translation | Timestamp |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sami'a** (سَمِعَ) | To hear (Sama'at) | **He heard** | |
| **Shariba** (شَرِبَ) | To drink (Shurb) | **He drank** | |
| **Karuma** (کَرُمَ) | To be noble (Karam) | **He became noble** | |
| **Qabuha** (قَبُحَ) | To be ugly (Qabahat) | **He became ugly/bad** | |
| **Marida** (مَرِضَ) | To be sick (Marz) | **He became sick** | |

> **Note:** The middle vowel change does not change the tense; it is just how that specific word is pronounced.

## 🔄 4. Active vs. Passive Voice (Ma'roof vs. Majhool)
How to change "He did" to "He was done to" (Passive Voice).

* **Active Voice (Past):** *Zaraba* (He hit).
* **Passive Voice Rule:**
    1.  First letter gets a **Pesh (Damma)**.
    2.  Second letter gets a **Zer (Kasra)**.
    3.  Third letter keeps the **Zabar (Fatha)**.
* **Pattern:** *Fu-'i-la*

### **Examples of Passive Voice**

| Active (He did...) | Passive (He was...) | Translation | Timestamp |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Zaraba** | **Zuriba** | **He was hit** | |
| **Qatala** | **Qutila** | **He was killed** | |
